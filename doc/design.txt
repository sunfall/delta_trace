Delta Trace (working title)

CONCEPT:
Story-based 8-bit futuristic tower defense with RPG elements

BACKGROUND:
You are an AI.  It has been ... years? decades? centuries? since the
time you were awake.  Your quiet slumber has been broken by the presence
of three malevolent presences, other AIs out to get you.  With the help
of ANNIE, can you destroy the interlopers before they destroy you?

CHARACTERS:
DELTA: The main character, an AI working to prevent its own destruction.
   "Female."
ANNIE: Autonomous Neural Network Information Executor.  A mini-AI "helper"
   that keeps Delta abreast of the incursion attempts by the three
   Antagonists, explains new abilities/enemies/etc. to her, and so on.
   "Female."

RED/body: One of the three Antagonists.  A brutish AI known for controlling
   robots and weaponry to bring physical force against humanity.  "Real"
   name: Armin, Alpha.  "Male."
BLUE/mind: One of the three Antagonists.  A brilliant but dangerous AI known
   for inventing new, sometimes subtle, destructive mechanisms to inflict
   upon humanity.  "Real" names: Cerul, Beta. "Female."
GREEN/soul: One of the three Antagonists. A manipulative AI known to use
   guile, a silver tongue, and pseudo-religious movements to coerce humanity
   towards its darker intents.  "Real" names: Emera, Gamma. "Male."

GAMEPLAY:
The game is divided into two main phases: the AETHER and the BATTLEFIELD.
The Aether is the "world map," represented by hexes that reveal themselves
as the game progresses.  The Battlefield is where the action takes place.

THE AETHER
The internal world of Delta Trace is a collection of hexes that make a
rough triangle, with Delta's starting point in the centre.  Each level is
represented by a hex, and completing a level opens up adjacent ones for
completion.

This is also where the STORY takes place, either via dialog with Annie or
via the internal musings of Delta.  The Aether represents the three AI's
assault on Delta's core, and as such there will occasionally be INCURSIONS,
triggered by progress in the game, which appear to set the player back but
in actuality open up new routes that are necessary to complete the game.
Other things such as DEVICE TOWERS and UPGRADES are also visible in the
Aether, giving players short-term goals to work towards.

INCURSIONS
At certain plot-related times, one of the three AIs (or <redacted>) may
cause an Incursion into the AETHER.  This may overtake some BATTLEFIELDS
that Delta already controls; however, an Incursion should fundamentally
change any levels where this occurs, so as to keep the game from being
repetitive.  In addition, an Incursion should always open up a new route
to something (new ENHANCEMENTS, CONTROL TOWERS, or a route to fight the
AI itself).

THE BATTLEFIELD
The Battlefield is where the general "tower defense" gameplay occurs.  It
is displayed as a CONTROL PANEL, with the vast majority of the panel
devoted to a view of the actual combat.  The player controls an AVATAR
of Delta, moving around the Battlefield to construct PROGRAMS on top of
CODEBASES, building TRACES to activate Codebases and DEVICE TOWERS, and
so on.  Waves of DISASSEMBLERS assault Delta's CORE CODE via the PATHS,
and the collapse of that Core Code is a loss on that particular
Battlefield.

AVATAR
Delta's Avatar is her representation both in the AETHER and on the
BATTLEFIELD.  In general, the player interacts with the game by moving
the Avatar over a location and using context-sensitive CONTROLS.  On
the Battlefield, it is possible for the Avatar to take DAMAGE and
experience a SOFT CRASH if it loses all of its HEALTH.

CORE CODE
Each BATTLEFIELD has a spot where Delta's Core Code on that Battlefield
is stored.  If DISASSEMBLERS reach the Core Code, it is damaged.  If too
many reach it, it is a HARD CRASH and the level is lost (but it may be
reattempted).  Delta's AVATAR can return to the Core Code to be repaired
before it experiences a SOFT CRASH.

DISASSEMBLERS
Disassemblers are the "creeps" of traditional tower defense.  They
(generally) follow the PATHS present in a given level, although certain
disassemblers can ignore the Paths and travel over other obstructions.
Some (but not all) Disassemblers have offensive capabilities, able to
cause DAMAGE to PROGRAMS or even Delta's AVATAR.

Destroying Disassemblers provides Delta with both EXECUTION POINTS and
PLOC.

HEALTH
Health is a graphical/numeric representation of how much DAMAGE a
PROGRAM, DISASSEMBLER, Delta's AVATAR, or her CORE CODE can take.

DAMAGE
PROGRAMS, DISASSEMBLERS, and Delta's AVATAR and CORE CODE can all take
damage.  When Disassemblers and Programs take more damage than their
HEALTH allows, they are destroyed; if Delta's Avatar takes more damage
than her health allows, she experiences a SOFT CRASH.  When the Core
Code takes more damage than its health allows, she experiences a HARD
CRASH.

SOFT CRASH
If Delta's AVATAR takes too much DAMAGE, she experiences a Soft Crash.
The CONTROL PANEL blanks out temporarily while her awareness reboots;
while this occurs, the game continues to run in the background (so
DISASSEMBLERS continue to approach), but all PROGRAMS are temporarily
disabled.  After the SOFT CRASH is over, Delta's AVATAR is returned to
her CORE CODE to continue playing.

HARD CRASH
If Delta's CORE CODE takes too much DAMAGE, she experiences a Hard Crash.
This causes an immediate loss of that Battlefield, although it may be
immediately re-attempted.  In addition, Delta may only keep a portion of
the EXECUTION POINTS she gained during the battle.

CODEBASES
Codebases provide the foundation for PROGRAMS, which Delta uses to attack
the DISASSEMBLERS that are attempting to compromise her CORE CODE.  Most
Codebases start out inactive, and Delta must build TRACES to their INPUTS
to activate them.  Programs on an inactive codebase do nothing.

Some spaces on Codebases hide MEMORY SHARDS; these are revealed and added
to the DATABANKS whenever a Program is built on top of the space that
hides the Memory Shard.

TRACES
Traces are the pathways by which Delta's CORE CODE provide executable
energy to CODEBASES, DEVICE TOWERS, and ENHANCEMENTS.  Traces cost nothing,
but Delta must spend time building them, and leaving a Trace incomplete
destroys that Trace.  Some locations on a BATTLEFIELD (the tops of
Codebases, Device Towers, and Upgrades, along with other specially-marked
locations) cannot have Traces built on top of them.

INPUT
CODEBASES, DEVICE TOWERS, and ENHANCEMENTS all have INPUTS.  All Inputs
must have active TRACES running to them to activate the associated
functionality.

OUTPUT
Some Codebases, Device Towers, and Enhancements may have Outputs.  The
AVATAR can construct new TRACES from an Output as a continuation of the
trace network.

PROGRAMS
Programs are the "towers" by which Delta destroys the approaching
DISASSEMBLERS before they can destroy her CORE CODE on each BATTLEFIELD.
Different types of Programs do different things, such as slow the
Disassemblers down, cause splash damage, and so on.  (The particular
Program types should be covered in a separate, more-detailed document.)
Programs cost PLOC to build and UPGRADE, and can be destroyed if they
take too much DAMAGE.

PLOC
PLOC are Petalines of Code, and are the "currency" with which Delta
"writes" PROGRAMS.  PLOC are not carried over between BATTLEFIELDS, as
the code written is specific to each Battlefield.

UPGRADES
PROGRAMS can be upgraded, although upgrades themselves may have to be
gained through an ENHANCEMENT.  Upgrades cost PLOC, but upgraded Programs
have additional functionality.

DEVICE TOWERS
Device Towers are located in certain BATTLEFIELDS.  If a Device Tower has
all of its INPUTS activated, it provides a significant benefit to both
the current Battlefield and those within a certain radius of effect.  A
sample Device Tower may increase SOFTWARE writing speed by 50% in the
current Battlefield, by 30% in those immediately adjacent, and by 15% in
those two hexes away.  Battlefields must be completed successfully for
the Device Tower's benefits to extend beyond the immediate battle.

ENHANCEMENTS
Enhancements are located in certain BATTLEFIELDS.  If an Enhancement has
all of its INPUTS activated, it gives Delta new functionality.  This can
be anything from new types of PROGRAMS, new levels of UPGRADES to her
existing programs, or permanent bonuses to Delta's abilties.  Battlefields
must be completed successfully for the Enhancement's benefits to extend
beyond the immediate battle.

(Note that Enhancements could even do things like open new routes, as a
sort of "gatekeeper" mechanism.  Care must be taken with this sort of
Enhancement, though, as it would be very irritating to have to continue
to replay a Battlefield because the player can't quite get to activating
the Enhancement before the battle is over.)

EXECUTION POINTS
Execution Points are a type of Experience that Delta gains as she
progresses through the Battlefields.  Execution Points (or EP) can be
spent on increasing her abilities permanently.  This provides players
with a way to "grind" past difficult levels, although it should (might?)
be possible to beat the game without spending EP.

MEMORY SHARDS
Memory Shards are pieces of Delta's fractured memory scattered about
certain Battlefields.  Collection of all of the MEMORY SHARDS is
necessary to unlock the path to the true ending of the game.  Further
details can be found in the STORY.

CONTROL PANEL
(Technical note: any static art on the panel must be toggleable to fight
potential burn-in on certain monitors and TVs.)

The Control Panel's design decisions should be covered in a separate,
more-detailed document.

STORY
The story should be covered in a separate, more-detailed document.
