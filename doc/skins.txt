Design and Implementation of Skins
==================================

Definition
----------

A skin decorates the UI borders of Delta Trace. These parts include (but are 
not limited to) the battlefield, the aether, and message boxes.

Creation
--------

The easiest way to create a skin is to follow the example of data/skins/basic.

You can follow these explicit directions, though:

- Make a directory in the data/skins/ directory. Name it the name of your skin.
- Create four 8x8 pngs
  - One that will be used for a vertical line
  - One that will be used for a northwestern corner
  - One that will be used for a 3-way split that is open on the west side
  - One that is quartered (looks like a plus)
- Create a [skin_name].dat file
  - It should have a single section called "Image Files"
  - It should have the keys straight, corner, t, and plus
  - It's values should point to the images you just created, respectively
- Run tools/apply_skins_to_maps.py with your skin name as the argument
- Check your skin directory

apply_skins_to_maps.py
----------------------

This script will generate images for every map file in the data/ui_maps 
directory. It will look in the data/skins directory for the arguments you 
give it.

If run with no arguments, the script will generate new maps for all skins in 
the data/skins direcroty.

You can give it as many arguments as you want.
